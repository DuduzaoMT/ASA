# ASA - Project
Analysis and synthesis of algorithms

## Description: 
- The objective of the ASA project is to develop the most optimized algorithms possible to solve problems. <br>
In this case, three problems were proposed: NP-hard, strongly connected components, and a minimum cut problem.

## Grade: 
 - 19 / 20
